**OpenPyTEA** is an open-source Python toolkit for performing **techno-economic assessment (TEA)** of chemical and energy systems. It was created to address a persistent gap in the TEA workflow: while process simulators model mass and energy balances, researchers often lack an equally transparent and flexible way to evaluate the **economic feasibility** of their designs. Commercial tools remain *black-box tools*, and many academic TEA implementations are process-specific, undocumented, or difficult to reproduce.

**OpenPyTEA** provides a fully open, modular, and traceable framework that brings TEA into the Python ecosystem. By integrating **equipment cost estimation**, **capital and operating expenditure modeling**, **cash-flow analysis**, **cost breakdowns**, **sensitivity evaluation**, and **Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation**, the toolkit enables users to perform end-to-end TEA with clarity and reproducibility.

Beyond its functionality, **OpenPyTEA is designed as a community-driven TEA platform**. Users can contribute new equipment cost correlations, improve economic models, report issues, and expand the toolkit’s capabilities over time. This collaborative approach helps build a shared, transparent, and continually improving TEA resource—similar to the open-source progress seen in the LCA community.

Whether used for early-stage process design, technology screening, or teaching, **OpenPyTEA** makes TEA more accessible, consistent, and aligned with FAIR research principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

## 🏗️ Software Architecture

![OpenPyTEA Architecture](examples/img/architecture.png)

Software architecture and data flow of **OpenPyTEA**, illustrating the progression from user input to TEA output. Users provide economic assumptions, process simulation results, and equipment-sizing parameters. Equipment-sizing information is linked with cost correlations and CEPCI values stored in CSV databases to calculate inflation-adjusted purchased and direct costs. `Equipment` objects are aggregated into a `Plant` object, where CAPEX, OPEX, and financial performance metrics are evaluated. The `analysis.py` module subsequently operates on `Plant` objects to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.

---

## 🖥️ Web GUI (**work in progress**)

OpenPyTEA includes an optional web-based graphical interface for users who prefer a visual workflow over Python scripting. The GUI provides the full TEA workflow through a tabbed browser interface:

- **Equipment** — add, edit, and remove equipment with cost database lookup
- **Plant Config** — configure location, financial parameters, labor, products, and variable OPEX
- **Results** — run calculations and view metric cards, cost breakdown charts, and cash flow tables
- **Analysis** — sensitivity plots and tornado diagrams. Sensitivity supports a **multi-panel grid** (different parameter and metric per panel, e.g. NPV vs. interest rate, ROI vs. electricity price, all in one figure) and **multi-plant overlay** (curves for every plant added on the Compare tab share the same axes for direct comparison)
- **Monte Carlo** — uncertainty analysis with histogram distributions, fitted normal curves, and summary statistics. **Multi-plant overlay** shows distributions for several plants on the same axes, mirroring `plot_multiple_monte_carlo` from the library
- **Compare** — side-by-side comparison of saved plants (CAPEX/OPEX breakdown bars, key metric bars). Plants imported here are also reused as the overlay set on the Analysis and Monte Carlo tabs
- **Downloadable charts** — all plots include a download button to export as standalone PNG images with full axis labels
- **Examples** — built-in presets from the case study notebooks for quick demonstration

### Running the GUI

**Quick start** (requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js — macOS/Linux):

```bash
./start.sh
```

That's it. On first run the script creates a local `.venv`, installs the backend dependencies, runs `npm install`, then launches both servers and opens your browser at http://localhost:5173. Subsequent runs just start the servers. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual steps</strong> (if you'd rather run backend and frontend yourself)</summary>

**Backend** (Python 3.10+):
```bash
pip install -e .          # install OpenPyTEA from repo root
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=../src python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend** (Node.js):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. **Equipment-level costing**

Each process unit (e.g., compressor, heat exchanger, reactor) is represented by an `Equipment` object:

```python
from openpytea.equipment import Equipment

compressor = Equipment(
    name='COMP',
    param=5000,  # kW
    category='Compressors, fans, & Blowers',
    type='Compressor, centrifugal',
    material='Carbon steel'
)

print(compressor.direct_cost)
```

Each equipment item retrieves its cost correlation from the internal database in `data/cost_correlations.csv` and adjusts the cost to the desired year using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

### 2. **Plant-level techno-economic assessment**

Multiple equipment objects can be grouped into a `Plant` instance for full TEA

```python
from openpytea.plant import Plant

ammonia_plant = Plant({
    'name':'Ammonia Production Plant', 
    'country':'Netherlands',
    'process_type':'Fluids', 
    'equipment'=[compressor],
    'interest_rate':0.09, 
    'plant_utilization':0.95, 
    'project_lifetime':20,  # in years
    'plant_products': {  # Here we define the product(s) of the plant
        'ammonia': {
            'production':125_000, # Daily production in kg/day,
        }
    },
    'variable_opex_inputs':{
        'electricity':{
            'consumption': 110,  # Daily consumption, in MWh 
            'price': 75  # US$/MWh
        },
        'hydrogen':{
            'consumption': 22_000,  # Daily consumption, in kg/day
            'price': 2  # US$/kg
        },
    },
})

plant.calculate_cash_flow(print_results=True)
plant.calculate_levelized_cost()
```
Main outputs include:
- Capital expenditures (CAPEX): inside/outside battery limits, engineering, contingency, and location factors
- Operating expenditures (OPEX): variable and operating expenditures, including utilities, maintenance, labor, and overhead costs
- Financial metrics: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Investment (ROI), Payback Time (PBT), and Levelized Cost of Product (LCOP)

### 3. **CAPEX and OPEX breakdown plots**

OpenPyTEA includes convenience functions for visualizing the economic structure of a process plant using stacked bar plots:

- `plot_direct_costs_bar(plant)`: direct equipment costs (per equipment item).  
- `plot_fixed_capital_bar(plant)`: fixed capital components (ISBL, OSBL, design & engineering, contingency).  
- `plot_variable_opex_bar(plant)`: variable operating costs by input mass and energy stream.  
- `plot_fixed_opex_bar(plant)`: fixed operating expenses, including labor, supervision, maintenance, overhead, R&D, and more.

These plots provide a quick visual breakdown of the main CAPEX and OPEX contributors in a flowsheet.

### 4. **Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis**

**OpenPyTEA** provides integrated tools for visual sensitivity and probabilistic analysis of cost and performance drivers.

One-Way Sensitivity Line Plot
```python
from openpytea.analysis import sensitivity_plot

results = sensitivity_plot(
    plant, 
    parameter="electricity", 
    plus_minus_value =0.5
    )
```
The `plant` input may also be a list of `Plant` objects to generate comparison plots.

Tornado Plot (One-at-a-Time Sensitivity)
```python
from openpytea.analysis import tornado_plot

tornado_plot(
    plant,
    plus_minus_value = 0.5,
)
```

Monte Carlo Simulation
```python
from openpytea.analysis import monte_carlo

results = monte_carlo(
    plant,
    num_samples=1_000_000
)

```
Outputs include probability distributions and confidence intervals for LCOP or NPV—supporting uncertainty-informed decision-making. With `plot_multiple_monte_carlo`, **OpenPyTEA** can also visualize Monte Carlo results for multiple plants to enable uncertainty comparisons.

### 5. **Workflow using JSON configuration files**

**OpenPyTEA** supports a workflow using structured JSON input files via the `io.py` module. This enables standardized, reproducible, and scalable TEA studies.

Key functionalities include:
- `run_equipment()`: evaluate equipment costs from JSON input
- `run_plant()`: construct and evaluate a plant configuration
- `run_tea()`: execute full TEA, including cost breakdowns, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis

This workflow is demonstrated in `case_study_1_with_JSON.ipynb` in the example folder.
