**OpenPyTEA:**  An open-source python toolkit for techno-economic assessment
of chemical process plants and energy systems with economic sensitivity
and uncertainty evaluation. It bridges process simulation tools —
which provide mass and energy balances — with rigorous economic evaluation,
covering capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), and key
financial metrics.

      Run TEA interactively without writing code. **Still in active development
      — not all features are available yet.**

Key features
------------

* **Modular architecture** — equipment costing, plant economics, and analysis are cleanly separated
* **Transparent methodology** — every formula is open and documented
* **Extensive financial metrics** — NPV, IRR, ROI, levelized cost, payback time, and full cash-flow tables
* **Multiple depreciation methods** — straight-line, declining-balance, MACRS
* **Sensitivity & uncertainty** — one-way sensitivity, tornado diagrams, Monte Carlo simulation
* **Interactive web GUI** — React + FastAPI front-end for no-code analysis *(work in progress)**
* **Reproducible workflows** — JSON-based configuration files and result export
* **Research-oriented design** — easy integration with other frameworks (optimization, LCA, etc.)
