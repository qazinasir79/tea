This section provides in-depth documentation for every feature of OpenPyTEA.

Walkthrough notebook
--------------------

The `OpenPyTEA walkthrough notebook <https://github.com/pbtamarona/OpenPyTEA/blob/main/walkthrough.ipynb>`_ is a
self-contained Jupyter notebook that covers the full workflow end-to-end —
equipment costing, plant configuration, financial calculations, sensitivity
analysis, and result export — with live code, outputs, and explanatory text.
It is the recommended starting point before reading the individual guide pages.

Overview of the workflow
------------------------

A typical OpenPyTEA study follows five steps:

.. code-block:: text

   1. Equipment costing  →  Equipment objects with purchased/direct costs
   2. Plant configuration →  Costs, financial parameters, products, OPEX
   3. Calculate           →  NPV, IRR, ROI, levelized cost, cash flows
   4. Analyse             →  Sensitivity, tornado, Monte Carlo
   5. Export              →  JSON results, publication-quality figures

Each step maps to a module:
