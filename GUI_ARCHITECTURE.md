# OpenPyTEA GUI Architecture

## Overview

The GUI is a client-server application wrapping the OpenPyTEA Python library. The backend exposes OpenPyTEA functionality as a REST API; the frontend renders a tabbed single-page app for the full TEA workflow.

## Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), runs on port 8000
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, runs on port 5173
- **Charts**: Recharts (React-native charting, no matplotlib on the frontend)
- **Styling**: Plain CSS (no framework), defined in `App.css`
- **State**: In-memory on the backend (module-level singletons in `state.py`). No database. Single-user session.

## Directory Layout

## Data Flow

1. **Equipment** is defined on the frontend and synced to `state.equipment_list` on the backend via CRUD endpoints (`POST/PUT/DELETE /api/equipment`). Each Equipment object is constructed server-side using `openpytea.Equipment`, which evaluates cost correlations and inflation adjustment immediately.

2. **Plant config** is a JSON dict stored in `state.plant_config`. The frontend form collects all parameters and sends them via `PUT /api/plant/config`. This dict is NOT yet a Plant object — it's just config storage.

3. **Calculate** (`POST /api/plant/calculate`) combines `state.plant_config` + `state.equipment_list`, constructs a `Plant(config)`, calls `plant.calculate_all()`, and stores the Plant object in `state.plant`. Results are extracted into a flat JSON dict and cached in `state.results`.

4. **Analysis** endpoints (`/api/analysis/*`) require `state.plant` to exist (i.e., calculate must run first). They call `openpytea.analysis` functions directly on the stored plant object.

5. **Monte Carlo** results are summarized server-side (histogram bins + stats) instead of sending million-element arrays. Raw results are kept in `state.mc_results` for potential follow-up.

6. **Save/Load** serializes/restores equipment list + plant config. On load, equipment is re-instantiated from saved params and plant is reset (must recalculate).

## Frontend Pages

### EquipmentPage
- Table with columns: #, Name, Category, Type, Material, Process, Param, Units, Purchased ($), Direct ($), actions
- Footer row with totals
- Modal dialog for add/edit with:
  - Category dropdown (populated from `/cost-db/categories`)
  - Type dropdown (cascading, shows param units and valid range)
  - Process type, material, target year dropdowns
  - Toggle between "size parameter" and "direct cost input" modes
- On submit, backend constructs Equipment and returns computed costs

### PlantConfigPage
- Four card sections: General, Financial, Labor, Products, Variable OPEX
- Country/region are cascading dropdowns from `Plant.locFactors`
- Products and variable OPEX are dynamic key-value editors (add/remove rows)
- Each product/opex item has: name, consumption/production, price, std, min, max (std/min/max used for Monte Carlo distributions)
- "Save Configuration" button sends to backend

### ResultsPage
- "Run Calculations" button (or "Recalculate" if results exist)
- Metric cards row: Levelized Cost, NPV, IRR, ROI, Payback Time
- Capital costs: table + horizontal bar chart with labeled axes (component names + currency)
- Fixed OPEX: table + horizontal bar chart with labeled axes
- Variable OPEX: table + bar chart with labeled axes
- Revenue breakdown: table + bar chart with labeled axes
- Cash flow table: year-by-year with CAPEX, Revenue, Costs, Depreciation, Gross Profit, Tax, Cash Flow, NPV
- All charts include a download button (arrow icon, top-right) to export as standalone PNG with full axis labels

### AnalysisPage
- **Sensitivity section**: parameter dropdown, +/- variation, points, metric selector. Line chart showing metric vs % change.
- **Tornado section**: +/- variation, metric selector. Horizontal bar chart with low (blue) / high (red) deviations from baseline.
- Parameters list is fetched from `/sensitivity/parameters` (includes top-level + variable_opex + products)
- Both charts downloadable as PNG

### MonteCarloPage
- Config: num_samples (default 50k), batch_size
- Summary stats table per metric: mean, std, p5, p25, median, p75, p95, min, max
- Histogram chart per metric with labeled axes (metric name + frequency), downloadable as PNG
- Input distributions summary table

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No matplotlib on frontend** — backend returns raw data; frontend renders charts with Recharts. The `openpytea.plotting` module is not used by the GUI.

2. **Monte Carlo summarization** — raw arrays (potentially millions of floats) are histogrammed server-side into ~80 bins. Only bin edges, counts, and summary stats are sent to the frontend (~10KB vs ~40MB).

3. **Equipment is constructed server-side** — the backend creates `Equipment()` objects immediately on add/update, so the cost correlation lookup and inflation adjustment happen before the response. The frontend just displays computed values.

4. **Plant is stateful** — `state.plant` holds the last-calculated Plant object. Analysis endpoints operate on this object. If equipment or config changes, the user must recalculate.

5. **Single-session model** — one equipment list, one plant, one set of results at a time. No multi-project support. Save/load provides persistence via JSON files.

6. **Example presets** — JSON preset files live in `backend/app/presets/`. Each contains a complete project (equipment + plant config) extracted from the case study notebooks. The frontend header has an "Examples" dropdown that lists them via `GET /api/project/examples` and loads one via `POST /api/project/examples/{id}`. Loading a preset replaces the current session and navigates to the Equipment tab. Adding a new example is just adding a `.json` file to the presets directory — no code changes needed.

7. **Response model validation** — all endpoints declare a `response_model` in their route decorator. FastAPI validates every response against typed Pydantic schemas before sending it to the client. This ensures the backend can never silently return malformed data, and auto-generates accurate OpenAPI/Swagger docs at `/docs`.

8. **Error surfacing** — all frontend API calls propagate errors to the global error bar (top of the page). No silent `.catch(() => {})` — every failure is reported to the user.

## Available Example Presets

| ID | Title | Source |
|----|-------|--------|
| `h2_smr` | Hydrogen - Steam Methane Reforming | Case Study 1 (14 equipment, US Gulf Coast) |
| `h2_methane_pyrolysis` | Hydrogen - Methane Pyrolysis | Case Study 1 (13 equipment, carbon co-product) |
| `h2_electrolysis` | Hydrogen - Water Electrolysis | Case Study 1 (3 equipment, direct costs) |
| `lh2_smr_best` | Liquid H2 - SMR Best Case | Case Study 2 (11 equipment, Netherlands) |
| `geothermal_heat_pump` | Geothermal Heat Pump | Case Study 3 (8 equipment, 30yr lifetime) |
| `geothermal_power_plant` | Geothermal Power Plant | Case Study 3 (7 equipment, ORC cycle) |

## Known Limitations / Future Work

- No multi-plant comparison in the GUI (the library supports passing lists of plants to analysis functions)
- No depreciation method configuration UI (the field exists in PlantConfig but has no dedicated editor)
- No additional CAPEX editor UI (fields exist but no dedicated add/remove interface)
- Monte Carlo runs synchronously — large sample counts block the API response (could add background task + polling)
- No input validation feedback on the frontend forms (relies on backend 400 errors)
- Cash flow table assumes scenario index 0 (the library supports multi-scenario arrays)
- The cost DB category dropdown shows raw CSV keys — could benefit from nicer formatting
- ~~No chart export/download functionality~~ (implemented — all charts downloadable as PNG)
- ~~No dark mode~~ (implemented)

## How to Run

**Backend:**
```bash
pip install -e .          # install OpenPyTEA from repo root
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=../src python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Bug Fix Applied

`src/openpytea/__init__.py` had `from io import ...` (stdlib) instead of `from .io import ...` (relative). Fixed to allow the package to import correctly.
